# revisiting the square fractal

add a depth

use sz = width / 3 \*\* dep;

to get the size as the seed is made of of width and height of 3 square

3^1 = 3 how many little squares height and with
3^2 = 9
3^3 = 27
3^4 = 81
3^5 = 243

but the number of seed shapes is

depth 1 = 1
2 = 3
3 = 9
4 = 27
5 = 81
